    "The `freud` library enables advanced analysis of particle simulations, particularly those utilizing periodic boundary conditions.\n",
    "This collection of Jupyter notebooks provides examples of how the different modules of `freud` can be used for different types of analysis.\n",
    "These notebooks may be launched [interactively on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/glotzerlab/freud-examples/master?filepath=index.ipynb) or downloaded and run on your own system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run locally:\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended method for installing `freud` is using conda-forge (`conda install -c conda-forge freud`), but for developers or non-conda users `freud` can also be installed from source by cloning [the Git repository](https://github.com/glotzerlab/freud).\n",
    "Note that `freud` itself requires [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) and [Intel TBB](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) for installation.\n",
    "These can be easily installed through package managers, like conda, and if you install `freud` through conda they will be automatically installed for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these notebooks also have a number of additional dependencies.\n",
    "In particular, all of these notebooks involve making plots with either [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) or [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/), so you will also need to install those to run these notebooks locally.\n",
    "Note that because Bokeh uses Javascript, if you are running these notebooks using JupyterLab you will need to execute an additional command for installation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter labextension install jupyterlab_bokeh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any issues with installing or seek more information about `freud`, please refer to the [`freud` documentation](freud.readthedocs.io/)."

    "There are a few critical concepts, algorithms, and data structures that are central to all of `freud`.\n",
    "In order to familiarize yourself with these before delving too deep into the workings of specific `freud` modules, we recommend looking through certain notebooks first.\n",

    "- [`freud.box`](https://freud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/box.html): The box module defines the Box object used throughout `freud` to represent periodic simulation boxes. Since all analysis methods involve some representation of particles in a box of some sort, it is useful to understand boxes and periodicity before attempting to use the rest of `freud`.\n",

These are described in the Reference documentation. Additional classes are demonstrated below.\n",
