    "## What is a NeighborList Filter?\n",
    "\n",
    "A neighborlist filter is a class which removes some bonds from a pre-defined neighborlist. A neighborlist filter can be thought of as a function for which an unfiltered `NeighborList` is given as the input and a filtered version of the input `NeighborList` is the output. Freud already has some methods in the `NeighborList` class like `filter` and `filter_r` which can achieve this concept, but often the full system definition is needed to decide which bonds to remove. This is often the case when typical neighbor finding algorithms which use `r_max` or `num_neighbors` label two particles as neighbors even though they are blocked by another particle in between them. Each of _freud_'s neighborlist filters defines the concept of \"blocking\" or being \"blocked\" differently and removes bonds between particles which are blocked by another particle."

    "The _freud_ library's neighborlist filter algorithms are the same as some well-known parameter-free neighbor finding methods like the Solid Angle Nearest Neighbor (SANN) method and the Relative Angular Distance (RAD) method. Each of these neighbor finding methods was created to find a set of neighbors in which no neighbor is blocked by any other neighbor. In that sense, _freud_'s neighborlist filters can be used to *find* neighbors as well as to *filter* neighbors. The difference between finding and filtering depends solely on the meaning attributed to the unfiltered neighborlist.\n",

Strictly speaking, we consider neighbors of a particle $i$ to consist of the nearest (i.e., closest) $m$ particles ${j}$ in neighborhood defined by shell radius $R_i^{(m)}$ such that the sum of their solid angles associated with $\\theta_{i,j}$ equals $4 \\pi$ :\n",

For example, plotting a $g(r)$ for the system and choosing an `r_max` slightly larger than fist peak distance can be used as a good starting point.
