    "## What is a NeighborList Filter?\n",
    "\n",
    "A neighborlist filter is a class which removes some bonds from a pre-defined neighborlist. A neighborlist filter can be thought of as a function for which an unfiltered `NeighborList` is given as the input and a filtered version of the input `NeighborList` is the output. Freud already has some methods in the `NeighborList` class like `filter` and `filter_r` which can achieve this concept, but often the full system definition is needed to decide which bonds to remove. This is often the case when typical neighbor finding algorithms which use `r_max` or `num_neighbors` label two particles as neighbors even though they are blocked by another particle in between them. Each of freud's neighborlist filters defines the concept of \"blocking\" or being \"blocked\" differently and removes bonds between particles which are blocked by another particle."

    "## The Solid Angle Nearest Neighbor (SANN) Method\n",
    "\n",
    "With the [Solid Angle Nearest Neighbor (SANN) method](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4729313), we look for enough nearby neighbors to fully occupy the $4 \\pi$ solid angle distribution surrounding a particle and label all neighbors further away as blocked. Strictly speaking, we consider neighbors going radially outward and define the solid angle occupied by each neighbor as [show the formula from the paper]. The `freud.locality.FilterSANN` class implements this method, and an example usage is shown below:"
