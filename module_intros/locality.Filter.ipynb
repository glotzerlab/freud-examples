    "## What is a NeighborList Filter?\n",
    "\n",
    "A neighborlist filter is a class which removes some bonds from a pre-defined neighborlist. A neighborlist filter can be thought of as a function for which an unfiltered `NeighborList` is given as the input and a filtered version of the input `NeighborList` is the output. Freud already has some methods in the `NeighborList` class like `filter` and `filter_r` which can achieve this concept, but often the full system definition is needed to decide which bonds to remove. This is often the case when typical neighbor finding algorithms which use `r_max` or `num_neighbors` label two particles as neighbors even though they are blocked by another particle in between them. Each of freud's neighborlist filters defines the concept of \"blocking\" or being \"blocked\" differently and removes bonds between particles which are blocked by another particle."

    "\n",
    "With the [Solid Angle Nearest Neighbor (SANN) method](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4729313), we look for enough nearby neighbors to fully occupy the $4 \\pi$ solid angle distribution surrounding a particle and label all neighbors further away as blocked. Strictly speaking, we consider neighbors of a particle $i$ to consist of the nearest (i.e., closest) $m$ particles ${j}$ in neighborhood defined by shell radius $R_i^{(m)}$ such that the sum of their solid angles associated with $\\theta_{i,j}$ equals $4 \\pi$ :\n",

To use these classes more efficiently, physical intuition about the system can be used to limit the number of neighbors in the unfiltered neighborlist. For example, plotting a $g(r)$ for the system and choosing an `r_max` slightly larger than fist peak distance can be used as a good starting point.
